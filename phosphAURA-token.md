## 🧬 What Is PhosphAURA?

PhosphAURA is the **multi-yield ignition token** of the Radon Exosystem.  
Forged from the principles of phosphorus (Element 15), it combines fiery utility with sustainable DeFi yield mechanics.

It yields **PLS**, **AURA**, and **RADON** while supporting multiple ecosystem tokens through buybacks and treasury routing.
