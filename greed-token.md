# 💰 GREED – Incentive Weaponized  
*"It is not a vice here. It is a feature."*

## 🧬 What Is GREED?

GREED is the **reward engine** of the Radon Exosystem.  
It’s a fixed-supply, high-impact, farm-and-incentive token designed to do one thing exceptionally well:

> Funnel yield and volume back into RADON.

By nature, GREED is aggressive. Its tokenomics create pressure and opportunity, feeding value into the core of the system while rewarding those who dare to wield it.

## 💸 Tokenomics Overview

| Type          | Buy (%) | Sell (%) | Destination         |
|---------------|---------|----------|----------------------|
| **Tax**       | 1.5     | 9.0      | Strategic split      |
| **Buy Tax**   | 1.5     | -        | Treasury (RADON/PLS/GREED) |
| **Sell Tax**  | -       | 9.0      | Treasury (split 3 ways) |

🧮 **Total Tax: 1.5% on Buys, 9% on Sells**  
Round-trip = 10.5% — buyers enter smoothly, sellers feed the beast.

## 🧪 Treasury Allocation (per transaction)

Each GREED transaction supports the core ecosystem via a **3-way treasury split**:

- **⅓ in PLS** → fuels liquidity and staking pools  
- **⅓ in RADON** → direct buy support for the system’s anchor  
- **⅓ in GREED** → stored for future emissions, farming rewards, or burns

This structure turns every sell into a **strategic sacrifice**—a cost that strengthens the whole system.

## 🔁 How GREED Supports RADON

- Executes **ongoing RADON buybacks** using its sell tax revenue  
- Feeds GREED tokens into LP incentives and RADON-yielding farms  
- Keeps supply fixed while value flow remains dynamic and cyclical

---

## 🌾 Use Cases

- Stake in GREED-native farms to earn RADON, ZION, and more  
- Contribute to LP pools to access the ecosystem’s highest APY  
- Accumulate to support future collabs and token emissions

## 🔢 Supply & Scarcity

- **Total Supply:** 11,140 GREED (Fixed) — mirrors RAGE  
- No inflation, no minting  
- Designed for long-term participation, not short-term dumping
