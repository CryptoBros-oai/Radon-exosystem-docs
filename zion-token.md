## 🧬 What Is ZION?

ZION is the **zero-tax, capped-supply** utility token of the Radon Exosystem.  
It was forged not to extract value, but to **unlock it**—serving as a gateway to advanced mechanics, farming loops, and utility-layer infrastructure.

It doesn’t burn, reflect, or inflate.  
ZION just **works**—quietly empowering the yield engine behind the scenes.

| **Tax**             | 0% (Buy / Sell / Transfer)    |
| **Utility**         | Farming loops, emissions pair |
| **Role**            | Utility-layer token for dApps |

## 🧪 Why It Matters

ZION enables core farming strategies without causing sell pressure or yield dilution.  
Its zero-tax nature makes it ideal for:

- **Pairing in high-yield farming loops**  
- **Earning tokens without triggering tax events**  
- **Serving as an emissions pair (e.g., ZION/GREED)**  
- **Fueling future dApps, raffles, bridges, and governance**

## ♻️ Farming Utility

ZION is currently part of a growing farm loop ecosystem:

**✅ Live Now:**
- `ZION / GREED` – stake LP to earn RADON and more

**🕒 Coming Soon:**
- `ZION / RAGE` – amplifying utility via wrath-fueled synergy

Its emission role helps create **looped yield mechanics**, such as:
> *Farm ZION/GREED → Earn RADON → Pair with PLS or farm again.*

## 🧙 Design Philosophy

ZION is a **priest-class token** in the Exosystem:
- It doesn’t brag. It **channels**.
- It doesn’t spike. It **stabilizes**.
- It doesn’t tax. It **transfers** value efficiently.
