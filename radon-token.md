## 🧬 What Is RADON?

RADON is the central pillar of the Radon Exosystem—a fixed-supply, yield-focused, and treasury-backed asset designed to be the **store-of-value** at the heart of everything.

Through real yield, reflections, and ecosystem incentives, RADON functions as the **gravitational anchor** of the Exosystem. And it is **actively supported by buybacks** from partner tokens: **GREED**, **PhosphAURA**, and **RAGE**.

## 🧪 Tokenomics Overview

| Type          | Asset       | Buy (%) | Sell (%) | Destination         |
|---------------|-------------|---------|----------|----------------------|
| **Reflection**| $RADON      | 1.5     | 1.5      | Holders              |
| **Yield**     | $DAI        | 3.8     | 3.8      | Holders              |
| **Support**   | $NEON       | 1.7     | 1.7      | Burn                 |
| **Support**   | $DARK       | 1.6     | 1.6      | Burn                 |

🧮 **Total Tax: 8.6% on Buys and 8.6% on Sells**  
Round-trip = 17.2% — each transaction fortifies the ecosystem.

## 🔢 Supply & Distribution

- **Total Supply:** 100,000,000 RADON (Fixed)
- No minting or inflation
- Allocations for LPs, rewards, and treasury-held strategic supply

---

## ♻️ How It Works

- RADON tax structure delivers:
  - **Reflections** of $RADON → automatically to holders
  - **Real Yield** in $DAI → paid out from ecosystem reserves
  - **Support** via $NEON and $DARK → for long-term system strength

- **RADON is actively supported** by:
  - **GREED**, **PhosphAURA**, and **RAGE** — each includes RADON buyback logic
  - These tokens help drive demand and sink supply of RADON over time

---

## 🏦 Treasury Role

The RADON treasury:
- Accumulates $DAI, $RADON, and other ecosystem tokens via transaction flow
- Supports RADON LPs and staking pools
- Gains additional support from external buybacks built into GREED, PhosphAURA, and RAGE

---

## 🧠 Strategic Role in the Exosystem

- RADON sits at the center of the Exosystem’s financial web
- It is the **primary value sink**, supported by surrounding tokens and mechanisms
- Holding RADON is equivalent to holding the **nuclear battery** powering the entire machine
